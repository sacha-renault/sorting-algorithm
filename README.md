# Sorting Algorithms Playground

A personal playground for implementing and understanding different sorting algorithms in Rust. This project exists primarily as a learning exercise to better understand both sorting algorithms and Rust's type system.

## What's Here

- Algorithms in src/algorithms, checkout for more info

## What's Next?

I might implement:
- Quick sort
- Heap sort
- Radix sort
- Other algorithms that catch my interest

This is mostly for my learning and experimentation. Feel free to use any of it if you find it helpful!
